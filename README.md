# Label-Tool
This tool is to label the bounding box and generate the label files. Put all the images(jpg) in Images/001. Run main.py.
Input the classes in the terminal(split by blank space). Click the corresponding button once you finish a bounding box.
Run together.py to get the overall label file.
